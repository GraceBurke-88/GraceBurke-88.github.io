<h1>IP Addresses, Packets, and Routing</h1>
    <h4>IP Addresses</h4>
    <p>Internet Protocol Address
        <br>Numerical label that is given to each device
        <br>Example: 123.123.123.123
        <br>Allows one computer to communicate with another computer.
        <br>Could be compared to a house address, since are used as identification and  finding locations.
    </p>
    <h4>Packets</h4>
    <p>A small amount of data that is sent over a network, such as the internet.
        <br>In the mail analogy the ‘packet’ can be thought of as a letter containing data, it has a source (home address) and a destination.
        <br>Packets are broken up pieces of a larger amount of data, this means that if one piece is dropped, that is the only thing that has to be sent again.
    </p>

    <h4>Routing</h4>
    <p>Routing is how packets are moved from their initial source to another destination
        <br>There are many paths packets can take to reach their final destination
        <br>Packets are sent and reassembled when the reach their final destination
        <br>Routers are like ‘traffic managers’, they keep the packets moving smoothly
        <br>Packets may arrive at different times or out of order

        <br>Routers will select the ‘cheapest’ path, this means the path that is the fastest and makes the most sense politically
        <br>Having several options makes networks ‘fault tolerant,’ which means data can still be sent, it if there is a major issue with one of the routes
    </p>
    <h4>TCP</h4>
    <p>
        Transmission Control Protocol
        <br>Ensures that all the packets are delivered.
       <br>If something is missing, TCP will request it to be resent
